## Data 
Palmerpenguins data set is provided by Dr. Allison Kristen Gorman. The goal of palmerpenguins is to provide a great dataset for data exploration & visualization

## Single trait distribution 
```{r}
view(penguins)
dim(penguins)
colnames(penguins)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_violin(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = species, color = sex)) 
  
penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, fill=species), alpha=0.5)
```


## Relationship between multiple traits 
relationship between body mass and flipper length 
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm))
```


## Sexual dimorphism 
Sexual dimprphism is distinct difference in size or appearance between the sexes of an animal in addition to difference between the sexual organs themselves.
what traits are sexually dimprohic in penguins ? (hint: use facet wrap)
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) + 
  facet_wrap(~species)
```

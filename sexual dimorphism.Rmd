## Sexual dimorphism 
Sexual dimprphism is distinct difference in size or appearance between the sexes of an animal in addition to difference between the sexual organs themselves.
what traits are sexually dimprohic in penguins ? (hint: use facet wrap)
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) + 
  facet_wrap(~species)
```
